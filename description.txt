ðŸŽ‰ Excited to Share My First Project: Code and Decode! ðŸŽ‰

I'm thrilled to unveil my inaugural project, "Code and Decode," which promises a fun and intriguing way to engage with secret messages. Whether you're a cryptography enthusiast or just someone who loves a good puzzle, this project is for you.

**Project Overview:**
"Code and Decode" empowers users to generate secret codes and provides clear guidelines for decoding them. For those who prefer automation, I've developed a program that seamlessly handles the decoding process.

**Decoding Instructions:**
ðŸ”’ For codes with exactly 4 letters: Simply reverse the code.
ðŸ”’ For codes with more than 4 letters:
 - Remove the first 5 and the last 5 letters.
 - Swap:
 - The 1st letter with the 2nd last letter.
 - The 4th letter with the last letter.
 - The 5th letter with the 3rd last letter.

And voila! You've successfully decoded the message, unraveling its hidden meaning.
